            <h2>About Dream</h2>
            <p>The first task I completed was to use P5JS to make a lost item. At that time, because I was absent from work, I could only choose to ask about my family about it. Finally, I focused my attention on a ring. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In the end, I made the effect that had been released. Every time it is refreshed, the position of the color block around the ring will change.</p>

            <h2>Introduction of the work</h2>
            <p>The story of this ring is interesting. Its prototype is related to an explanation that my mother lost in the past, but I prefer to use the following introduction:<br><br>  

            I had a dream, as if I had traveled to another world. I knew I was dreaming, so I recorded the sounds in the dream and wrote them down after waking up. This caused me a headache<br><br>
            The sound is as follows:<br><br>

            Protonia, Protonia, when the rings of the three gods gather together, the power of Othem will become Sohowton (The Heavenly principles)<br>
            
            Let's shout:Triloka trimūla tri-viśrāma-bheda<br>
            (The first line addresses a flaw within the fundamental cosmic triads.)<br><br>
            
            Nir triśīrṣa sapta-prārthanā-bheda<br>
            (The second line speaks of a void-like state facing multiple distinct yearnings.)<br><br>
            
            Hārahanū yita-tacchara<br>
            (The third line invokes distant realms and protective figures.)<br><br>
            
            Sigucira latraya ekānā<br>
            (The fourth line envisions the coalescence of ancient, layered complexities into a singular unity.)
            <br><br><br>

            The reason why this ring was lost, I believe it was not simply left somewhere, but rather fell into another world and was treated as a treasure. After all, everyone has had an experience where something that was lost suddenly appeared out of thin air, right?</p><br><br>
