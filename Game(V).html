            <h2>About Game</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>This is the final P5JS task, to make a game<br><br>
                I think the gameplay of the game should be very simple. Blue beats red, that's all, just as simple as extinguishing the fire with a water, so I started to make it. What below is the result</p><br><br>

                <h2>Background Story </h2><br>

                From the sky descends a mighty hand,<br>
                People scatter, no place to stand.<br>
                They fight with grit, against the night,<br>
                Praying for miracles, seeking the light.<br><br>

                The Blue God rises, their faith to renew,<br>
                A spark of hope, a flame so true.<br>
                With wonders revived, and courage drawn,<br>
                The Blue departs, but faith lives on.<br><br>

                Red and Blue clash in fierce array,<br>
                Blood paints the skies, and clouds turn gray.<br>
                Power meets power, fury meets flame,<br>
                The world holds its breath, as they play their game.<br><br><br>

                <h2>Rule:</h2>

                As a god, you rise with power bold,<br>
                Guiding the Blue, a force to hold.<br>
                Against the Red, your will commands,<br>
                To shape the fate of distant lands.<br><br>

                Time is fleeting, life drains away,<br>
                Each second counts in this fierce fray.<br>
                With ease you wield fate’s final call,<br>
                A world’s destiny rests on your thrall.<br><br>

                In your hands, creation’s might,<br>
                To cast in shadow or bring to light.<br>
                So play your moves with purpose true,<br>
                For all that’s left depends on you. <br><br><br>
