            <h2>Home</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the CC Lab Final homepage. This is a simple demonstration page with a consistent sidebar and header across all pages.<br>
                The half-year course has ended, and I've learned a lot during this process. I have a new understanding of P5JS and HTML, although sometimes I have to ask AI some questions, but in the end, I successfully overcame all the difficulties.<br><br>
                
                
                The content of this website mainly summarizes all the P5JS tasks I have completed this year. I have averaged them into the following five chapters, and please allow me to briefly introduce the content of these five chapters.<br><br><br>

                <h2>Chapter Introduction:</h2>

                The first chapter is named Dream, which can represent both having a dream and the dream itself, symbolizing the beginning of everything.<br>
                Although I fell behind on many courses at the time, I managed to catch up in the end. In this chapter, I completed a painting that I considered quite complex.<br><br>

                The second chapter is Time. In fact, it was in this chapter that I started to complete the Dream content, as I fell behind on many courses in the early stages,
                and I did not produce any particularly good tasks in this chapter. In this chapter, I only completed a clock that changes the sun. It should be noted that the ship at the end is deliberately placed here to compensate for 
                the lack of content in this chapter, so just treat it as a demo for the ship task.<br><br>

                The third chapter is Identity. This is also a chapter where I accumulated knowledge. 
                I encountered some psychological problems in the middle of the semester, so the content of this chapter is also somewhat lacking. 
                In this chapter, I only completed a self-portrait and a simple painting.<br><br>

                The fourth chapter's theme is Control or Suppression, mainly meaning to accumulate abilities, and finally complete a good game. In this chapter, 
                I learned how to control the keyboard with the keyboard and further control P5JS with the mouse. In fact, it was here that I completed the ship task.<br><br>

                The content of the fifth chapter is a game. I completed a game with complex functions, including a small test demo, thus completing the CC Lab P5JS part.<br><br>
