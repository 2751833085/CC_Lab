            <h2>About Identity</h2>
            <p><br>
                The third big theme is identity. My own identity, the identity in my heart and the identity of my performance are different.<br><br>
                For my external identity, that's how I look, so I did it directly.<br>  
            </p>

            <p>The second work is My Inner Me, which is also quite funny to say. I took a lot of time to know that I didn't have time to design P5JS at all in the end, resulting in the final product being very bad.</p><br>

                    You may have doubts<br><br>
                    However, the information I provided at the time was as primitive as that.<br><br>
                    <h2>Background Story </h2>
                    On this planet, there is a genius puppeteer. The puppets he creates have souls and "hearts." The puppeteer was hurt in the heart by humans. He hates humans and also himself, unlike the puppets, many humans even do not have a "heart." 
                    To protect his creations from the harm of evil people, the puppeteer gave the dolls tails and put them into the sea. He thought this would keep his works and his "children" away from humans, 
                    but did the puppets really gain freedom. Does entering the ocean mean that the dolls have escaped human rules? That is another story. <br><br>
                    Black represents a part of human nature and evil. White represents freedom, just like fish swimming freely in the ocean, 
                    but the black and white together make up the dolls, which are also truly human, a product of contradiction, where both black and white are indispensable. The content of the story seems to have nothing to do with paintings at all, 
                    hahaha, that's what I also think now.<br><br><br>
